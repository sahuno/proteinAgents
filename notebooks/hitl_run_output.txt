You: 
Assistant: Based on your protocols, I suggest including these similar methods:

**Your protocols:**
  - co immunoprecipitation
  - affinity purification

**Suggested additions:**
  - 1. Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening
  - 2. Pull-Down Assay
  - 3. Surface Plasmon Resonance
  - 4. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
  - 5. Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP)

Please review and respond with:
- "approve all" to include all suggestions
- "approve: <protocol1>, <protocol2>" to select specific ones
- "add: <new_protocol>" to suggest additional protocols
- "skip suggestions" to use only your original protocols

You: 
Assistant: Based on your protocols, I suggest including these similar methods:

**Your protocols:**
  - approve all

**Suggested additions:**
  - To identify complementary experimental methods for studying protein-protein interactions, I'll suggest a few commonly used techniques that expand on or complement user-provided protocols. Here are 5 additional methods:
  - 1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
  - 2. Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening
  - 3. Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC)
  - 4. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)

Please review and respond with:
- "approve all" to include all suggestions
- "approve: <protocol1>, <protocol2>" to select specific ones
- "add: <new_protocol>" to suggest additional protocols
- "skip suggestions" to use only your original protocols

You: 
Assistant: Based on your protocols, I suggest including these similar methods:

**Your protocols:**
  - approve

**Suggested additions:**
  - Certainly! Here are additional similar experimental methods commonly used in protein-protein interaction studies:
  - 1. Yeast Two-Hybrid Assay
  - 2. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
  - 3. Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
  - 4. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)

Please review and respond with:
- "approve all" to include all suggestions
- "approve: <protocol1>, <protocol2>" to select specific ones
- "add: <new_protocol>" to suggest additional protocols
- "skip suggestions" to use only your original protocols

You: 
Assistant: Based on your protocols, I suggest including these similar methods:

**Your protocols:**
  - accept

**Suggested additions:**
  - Sure, I can help with that. The user protocol "accept" isn't entirely clear as it seems to be a typo or incomplete. For protein-protein interaction studies, some common experimental methods include:
  - 1. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
  - 2. Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) Assay
  - 3. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)
  - 4. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)
